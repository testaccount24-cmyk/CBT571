                Overview
                --------

XMIT370 is a program for execution under MVS 3.8J, which provides
facilities similar to the TSO/E TRANSMIT command processor.
As opportunities present themselves, I'm testing it under other
versions of MVS.

XMIT370 will, given a DSORG=PO or DSORG=PS dataset as input, produce
an XMIT file as output.

The resulting XMIT dataset can be processed using the TSO/E RECEIVE
command processor, Hercules dasdload (for DSORG=PO datasets), my
RECV390 program (for DSORG=PO datasets), or any of the other UnXmit
programs as detailed at http://planetmvs.com on the UnXmit Information
Exchange page.


                Installation
                ------------

For installation instructions, refer to the $INSTALL member.
If you wish to install XMIT370 only, see the JXMITALL member.


                Demonstration JCL
                -----------------

JXMITPDS        Create XMIT from partitioned dataset (PDS; DSORG=PO)
JXMITSEQ        Create XMIT from sequential dataset (DSORG=PS)


                XMIT370 JCL
                -----------

XMIT370 is a batch program, and requires APF authorization.

XMIT370 DDNAMEs:
----------------

        SYSPRINT        IEBCOPY output messages (required for DSORG=PO
                        input datasets on SYSUT1)

        XMITLOG         XMIT370 output messages (required)

        SYSUT1          input dataset to be XMIT370'd (required)

        SYSUT2          work dataset for IEBCOPY for DSORG=PO datasets;
                        should be large enough to contain SYSUT1
                        plus a little more (required for SYSUT1
                        DSORG=PO).
                        Temporary dataset deleted at end of step is OK.

        XMITOUT         XMIT370 output XMIT dataset (required)
                        Any DCB attributes you specify are currently
                        ignored.
                        Should be large enough to contain SYSUT1
                        plus some more for the XMIT370 "wrapper" and
                        any IEBCOPY overhead data (10 - 20% more
                        should be sufficient).

        SYSIN           IEBCOPY input dataset (required for SYSUT1
                        DSORG=PO datasets).
                        A DUMMY dataset.

        XMITDBUG        Optional, specifies debugging options.

Hercules users:

   For input datasets of DSORG=PO, you can use the Hercules dasdload
   program to restore the PDS to a dasd volume.

   You can also use the dasdpdsu program to extract the members from a
   PDS on Hercules dasd.

XMIT370 only supports input datasets of DSORG=PO and DSORG=PS.
I have concentrated most of my testing on RECFM=FB input datasets.
