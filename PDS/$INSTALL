                Introduction
                ------------

Welcome to xxxx370.  This is the $INSTALL file, which describes the
installation of the xxxx370 programs.

All xxxx370 programs require APF authorization.

Note for experienced systems programmers: please excuse my long
explanations, some portions of my target audience are just getting
started, and are possibly running MVS versions as old as MVS38j.
Quick install instructions: run JINSTALL, review the individual
program's documentation members ($DAST, $RECV, $STCP, $XMIT).

                Overview
                --------

The xxxx370 programs are designed for execution under MVS 3.8J, running
under the Hercules emulator.  For a list of the xxxx370 applications
and their function, see the $INTRO member.


                Installation
                ------------

If you're reading this, you've already figured out how to extract
the source code, JCL, and documentation from the archive, and
used TSO/E RECEIVE, or some work-alike facility to re-create the
PDS.  Not much else to do.

JINSTALL
--------

Note: JINSTALL builds all the included applications:
DAST370, RECV370, XMIT370.

Modify the JINSTALL job as required for your shop.  In particular,
don't forget to change the LINK step SYSLMOD dataset.  The xxxx370
programs must be run from an APF authorized load module.
The SYS2.LOCAL.LINKLIB is what I use on my home MVS38j system.

If you're new to the systems programming game, you may need to review
and/or modify your SYS1.PARMLIB(IEAAPFxx) or SYS1.PARMLIB(PROGxx)
members, depending on your release of MVS.  More recent versions of
MVS allow PARMLIB datasets which aren't named SYS1.PARMLIB.  If you
aren't sure what you're doing, ask someone for help.  Messing up
PARMLIB members on a production system would be a Very Bad Thing.

The job steps are:

        DELETE          Delete SYS2.xxxx370.*
        ALLOC           Allocate SYS2.xxxx370.*
        DAST....        Assemble DAST.... source
        RECV....        Assemble RECV.... source
        U370....        Assemble U370.... source
        XMIT....        Assemble XMIT.... source
        LINK            Linkage edit xxxx370 applications

There's nothing special about using the ASMF assembler (IFOX00),
it's just what comes with MVS38j.  Replace with your preference of
(more capable) assembler at will.

Once you have modified JINSTALL, submit it.  All steps should get
RC=0, with the possible exception of the DELETE step which might get
RC=8, and the LINK step which will probably get rc=4.

The target load library may be in the linklist, and must be an
APF authorized dataset.

This concludes the installation of xxxx370.
Good luck and enjoy!
