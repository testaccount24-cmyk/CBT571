XMIT370 v00.04 notes:

During testing, I tried to receive the created XMIT files on as
many different environments as possible.  Special thanks to those
kind souls who helped test various MVS environents.


Hercules 2.16.2 dasdload
------------------------

works fine, with and without modification to COPYR1 record


RECV390 v1r1m5 (not released, I'm still working on it)
--------------

works fine, with and without modification to COPYR1 record


MVS38j RECV370
--------------

JINSTALL - install XMIT370 & RECV370
JXMIT    - create XMIT without modifying COPYR1 record
JXMITC   - create XMIT with COPYR1 modification
JRECV    - receive XMIT files created above

works fine, with or without modifications to COPYR1 record


MVS/ESA TSO/E RECEIVE
---------------------

Interesting behavior demonstrated by IEBCOPY, which complains that
the COPYR1 length is invalid.  The COPYR1 that IEBCOPY displays
looks nothing like the COPYR1 in the XMIT, which I verified by
running RECV370 which spins out a SYSUT1 file that I Full-Screen
Zapped.  An intended side-effect of running RECV370 is that it
simply unwraps the XMIT and places it on the SYSUT1 ddname.  That
it actually calls IEBCOPY is merely a happy coincidence.  ;-) What is
causing this behavior, I can't exactly say at this point and time.
I have a mild suspicion that there's a problem with the segments:
either a key that RECEIVE doesn't understand, or possibly a
construction error.  Unfortunately, I had very limited time on this
system, so it is as yet undetermined.  However, as time becomes
available, I'll keep pluggin away at it.  If someone has spare cycles
on an Internet-connected MVS/ESA system I can use to further test,
I'd be very happy to hear from you (jmorrison@ameritech.net).

I'd like all of XMIT370's XMITs to RECEIVE properly under MVS/ESA,
but as of right now that's not the case.  If your version of IEBCOPY
can cope with MVS38j IEBCOPY's COPYR1 record, you're golden.

To the extent that RECV370 works, it acts as a decent substitute
for TSO/E RECEIVE on MVS/ESA so all is not lost.  The very same XMIT
that TSO/E RECEIVE/IEBCOPY complained about received fine with RECV370.
I'm sure that's a clue of some kind.
