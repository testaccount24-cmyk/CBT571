Subject: RECV370 File571 v00.06

Greetings,

With Sam G's help there is now an updated version of the
MVS38j RECV370 program available for download on the CBT
updates page http://cbttape.org/updates.htm .

http://cbttape.org/ftp/updates/CBT571.zip  (CBT Tape Updates File 571)

The only real change between v00.05 and v00.06 is to
RECV370, and that only to repair a bug exposed when
the XMIT control record(s) span segments.  Frequently
the error caused by this bug was reported by RECV370
as "unknown key" and some seemingly random key.

Since the other code in File571 uses the same version
symbol, all the code built from source will reflect
v00.06: DAST370 (Dual Address Space systems programmer
toy), RECV370, and XMIT370.  The STCP IP Stack code has
not been updated and possibly may not assemble with the
current macros.  If you wish to build the STCP370 code
please use the macros from $OLDF571.

Enjoy!

Jim Morrison
