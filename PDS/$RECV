                Overview
                --------

RECV370 is a program for execution under MVS 3.8J, which provides
facilities similar to the TSO/E RECEIVE command processor.
As opportunities present themselves, I'm testing it under other
versions of MVS.

RECV370 will, given an XMIT file as input, produce a sequential or
partitioned dataset as output.

RECV370 will process XMIT files produced by either the TSO/E TRANSMIT
command processor, the XMIT370 batch program, or a similar facility.
RECV370 supports DSORG=PO and DSORG=PS datasets in the XMIT file.


                Installation
                ------------

For installation instructions, refer to the $INSTALL member.
If you wish to install RECV370 only, see the JRECVALL member.


                Demonstration JCL
                -----------------

JRECVPDS        Create XMIT from partitioned dataset (PDS; DSORG=PO)
                and then receive it

JRECVSEQ        Create XMIT from sequential dataset (DSORG=PS)
                and then receive it


                RECV370 JCL
                -----------

RECV370 is a batch program, and requires APF authorization.

RECV370 DDNAMEs:
----------------

    RECVLOG        RECV370 output messages (required)

    RECVDBUG       Optional, specifies debugging options.

    XMITIN         input XMIT file to be received (required)

    SYSPRINT       IEBCOPY output messages (required for DSORG=PO
                   input datasets on SYSUT1)

    SYSUT1         Work dataset for IEBCOPY (not needed for sequential
                   XMITs; required for partitioned XMITs)

    SYSUT2         Output dataset - sequential or partitioned

    SYSIN          IEBCOPY input dataset (required for DSORG=PO XMITs)
                   A DUMMY dataset.

RECV370 only supports input datasets of DSORG=PO and DSORG=PS.
I have concentrated most of my testing on DSORG=PO RECFM=FB datasets.
