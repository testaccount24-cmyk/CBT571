                             TCP/IP
                             ------

Overview
--------

TCP/IP is designed to run exclusively in MVS38j under the Hercules
emulator in S/370 mode

Hercules is a GPL'd project initially written by Roger Bowler,
currently maintained by Jay Maynard, with major contributions by
a numerous list of fine souls including such luminaries as
Jan Jaeger, Greg Smith, and David Trout (Fish) to name but a few.

MVS38j is available in the public domain, and in various flavors
from Volker Bandke, Jay Moseley, Jay Maynard, and others

For further information on both Hercules and MVS38j, see the following
Yahoo communities, particularly the Bookmarks sections of the
web sites:
