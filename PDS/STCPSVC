STCPSVC  TITLE 'TCP/IP SVC'

*----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  To do:
*  1) Filter authorized port requests when SVC caller not APF auth'd
*  2) Set SSTC1SVC flag after checking SSOB address
*     Indicates caller isn't necessarily APF authorized, and hence
*     may not be as trusted as APF authorized code
*     Should trigger additional checks in subsys function code
*     rather than trusting that the SVC has validated the request
*     since sneaky user may set SSTC1SVC is it means additional auth
*----------------------------------------------------------------------
         U#SET FUNC=STCP

* Function:    TCP/IP SVC
*
* Entry:  Supervisor state, Key 0, enabled
*
*         Registers as set up by SVC FLIH:
*
*         R0   SVC issuer's R0
*              currently unused
*         R1   SVC issuer's R1
*              R1 -> A(SSOB) for IEFSSREQ/IEFJSREQ
*         R3   @ CVT
*         R4   @ TCB of SVC issuer
*         R5   Type 2, 3, 4 SVC: @ SVRB
*              Type 1, 6    SVC: @ last RB
*         R6   SVC routine entry point addr
*         R7   @ ASCB of SVC issuer
*         R13  SVC issuer's R13
*              standard 18-word savearea
*         R14  return address
*         R15  SVC issuer's R15
*              currently unused
*
*         R2, R8 - R12 are unpredictable
*
* Exit:   R0, R1, and R15 are only regs which are returned to the
*         SVC issuer; R2 - R14 restored by system before giving
*         control back to SVC issuer
*
* Notes:  See STCPSVC0 for notes & SVCTABLE steal

STCPSVC  UPROC ID=SVC,INIT=NONE,ENTRY=R6
*----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Pass caller's SSOB to TCP/IP subsys function code in LPA
*----------------------------------------------------------------------
         USING STCPSVC,R6
         LR    R8,R14                  save return addr
*
*  Verify SSOB address is within acceptable bounds, set
*  SSTCFLG1.SSTC1SVC flag (SSOB passed through SVC)
*
*  Acceptable bounds:
*     Within user program in private area
*     Within user subpool in private area
*     Authorized caller: anywhere
*
         IEFSSREQ ,                    call SYM11 IEFJSREQ
*
*  Practically speaking, the LPALIB function code doesn't return here
*  but rather to the SVC FLIH directly (that's how IEFJSREQ sets up
*  the regs for the LPALIB function code); still, doesn't hurt to
*  burn two instructions "just in case"....

         BR    R14                     return to SVC FLIH
