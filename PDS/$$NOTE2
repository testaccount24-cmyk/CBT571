I checked the JXMITPDS member that Phil updated, and I believe
the version I supplied includes his changes.  Same with U370DATE.

I updated my email address in the @FILE571.txt file, attached.

That's all I've seen so far, and everything above is pretty minor.

Thanks for all your great work at CBT!

Best wishes,
Jim

Note from Sam Golob:  Object decks for all modules are in a PDSLOAD
    format (i.e. IEBUPDTE SYSIN format with ISPF stats) member called
    OBJECT.  Load library for all modules is in XMIT-format as member
    LOADLIB.  You will need RECV370 (or TSO RECEIVE) to extract this
    to a load library, so it's better to get your load library from
    running the JINSTALL job.  The member called JINSTAL1 runs on a
    system that I have access to, and is Jim's job as customized by
    me.
