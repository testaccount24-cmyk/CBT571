//***FILE 571 is from Jim Morrison, and contains XMIT370 and        *   FILE 571
//*           RECV370.  These are tools to create and handle        *   FILE 571
//*           XMIT-format pds files (which are FB-80 sequential     *   FILE 571
//*           files) on MVS systems (such as MVS 3.8) which do      *   FILE 571
//*           not contain the TSO XMIT and RECEIVE commands.        *   FILE 571
//*                                                                 *   FILE 571
//*           XMIT and RECEIVE were first shipped with TSO/E,       *   FILE 571
//*           so any pre-TSO/E TSO releases probably do not have    *   FILE 571
//*           the XMIT and RECEIVE capabilities.                    *   FILE 571
//*                                                                 *   FILE 571
//*           These tools are batch programs, and are not TSO       *   FILE 571
//*           commands, as are the TSO/E XMIT and RECEIVE programs. *   FILE 571
//*                                                                 *   FILE 571
//*           These programs were created so that Hercules MVS 3.8  *   FILE 571
//*           users can handle XMIT-format sequentialized pds'es.   *   FILE 571
//*                                                                 *   FILE 571
