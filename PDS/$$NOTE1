Hi Sam,

I am sending you a complete source refresh v00.06, **minus** the
members you guys incorporated into CBT file 571 ($OLDFILE,
@FILE571, and so forth).  This is the first version which removes
the IP Stack source code (well, most of it), since it's in your
$OLDFILE.  I couldn't see any need to have it in two places, and
the current source is drifting away from the old IP Stack source
anyway.

Sorry to say, testing has been extremely light  :-(    Perhaps more
at some later date.

Anyway, find attached an uncompressed XMIT from SYS2.XMIT370.ASM
on a 3380 with the faked-out z/OS IEBCOPY unload COPYR1 record
(COPYR1 ddname in XMIT370).  Please let me know if you have
problems dealing with it.  Greg said you had some issues with an
XMIT he sent you but it sounded like his source DASD volume had
issues.  He planned to spin a new 3390 and retry the XMIT, IIRC.

Best wishes,
Jim
