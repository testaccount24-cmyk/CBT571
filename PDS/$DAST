Overview
--------

DAST370 is a toy application I used to experiment with the S/370
Dual Address Space (DAS) feature under Hercules.

Currently, all it does is run the ASVT and display the ASCBs and
ASXBs.

Note that MVS38j never supported DAS, but if you're willing to either
install some MVS mods or modify the system's control registers
yourself, it's "usable".  As of this writing, no such MVS mods exist
but similar modifications will have to be written to support the
LIB390 project, so it's likely DAS support will be included in
that effort.

DASTMVCP - performs block moves from another address space usng MVCP
DASTVTAB - VCON table
DAST370  - ID=MAIN, driver
JDAST    - JCL to run DAST370
JDASTALL - Build only DAST370 application
JDAST1   - Assemble & link only one DAST370 CSECT
KBUGDAST - DASTDBUG control statements
KLNKDAST - Linkage editor control statements to build DAST370
